\begin{block}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item We introduced the ideas of self-correcting algorithm to build fault tolerant algorithms. 
	
\item We presented a self-correcting label propagation algorithm for graph connected component problem.
\item Key steps involved:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Analyze valid and invalid state;
	\item Use self-correction hypothesis to simplify invalid state detection;
	\item Use previous valid states to recover from invalid state. 
	\end{itemize}

	
\item Asymptotically lower overhead for fault detection and correction. 
\item 10-35\%  increases in execution time for one error for 64 memory operations.

	
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

% \begin{block}{Outlook}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Comparing self-stabilization formulation with self-correcting formulation.
% \item Fill this up.
