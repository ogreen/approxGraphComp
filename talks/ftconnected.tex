each vertex belongs to.

\begin{itemize}
\item Propagates the minimum label in the connected component.
\item We maintain a \emph{label} array $CC$ for each vertex.
\item $CC$ is initialized to vertex id for each vertex.
\item In each iteration, each vertex calculates minimum label among all near-neighbours $\mathcal{N}(v)=v\cup adj(v)$
\[ CC^{i}[v] = \min_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} CC^{i-1}[u]. \]
\item Iteration terminates when no change occur in an iteration.

We apply principle of self-correction to resolve the apparent difficulty in verifying state validity.
\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> We assume the previous state $CC^{i-1}$ is a valid one.
\item<3-> Checking 
\[ CC^{i}[v] = \min_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} CC^{i-1}[u], \]
 where  $\mathcal{N}(v) \equiv v \cup adj(v)$ is the immediate \emph{neighborhood} of $v$, {\color{red} will require re-computing entire iteration.}
\item<4-> We show that $CC^{i}[v]$ is still a valid value even if we can relax the minimization criterion to
\[
CC^{i}[v] \in \{ CC^{i-1}[u] \, | \, u \in \mathcal{N}(v) \}, %CC^{i-1}[v]_{adj} \},

\begin{theorem}
Given a valid state for the previous iteration, $CC^{i-1}$, the current connected component array $CC^{i}$ is a valid state if for all vertices $v$, $CC^{i}$ satisfies these conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $CC^{i}[v] \leq v$; and
